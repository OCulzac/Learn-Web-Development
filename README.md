#Learn the Web

**Awesome resources to become a web developer.**

##Foreword
Many People have asked me the route to learn web development quickly or as fast as possible. My answer to them is: there's isn't one. Web development is such a big concept that it'd be impossible to learn in just a few months. This guide I wrote is the path I took to learn what I know about web development in a year. Naturally, this guide doesn't include all the mistakes I made and all the time I lost trying to teach myself a technology that didn't click with me. I listed all that I learned but you won't have to waste time. I will exclude things like text editors and version control because those are personal preferences. Enjoy:

## Learning Hubs
These are links to places I go to when I have a question.
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn)
* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
* [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/)
* [Webdev Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/)
* [JavaScript Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript)
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

##Guides
These links are the steps I took to learn web development, in order, and the time it takes to master it, with practice included:

###HTML and CSS ( 1 to 2 months to dominate. )
It is worth noting that since thisi is the base of all your development education, you shouldn't move on to the next topic before mastering html and css.
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
The HTML&CSS course, I didn't finish it, because I started practicing right off the bat. I made about 3 wesbites before moving on to the next topic. So when I came back to this course I had already learned all of it and more.

###Responsiveness, frameworks, and advanced topics ( 2 weeks to a month. )
Alright, so you think you know html and css. But what do you know about responsivness? Or frameworks like Bootstrap or Skeleton? What about animations? Not to worry I'll link them to you, no wasting time and searching on the web.

* [How to Bootstrap](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IPwMW-sSXn1Q_pVu5tUMCw)
Bootstrap is the biggest guy on the block, it has many awesome features like a grid, boxes, tables, modals, and javascript functionality. My personal problem with this, and any other frameworks is that developers never get into the responsivness of things, they don't know what's happening don't explore the possibilities and what's our there waiting for them. It's an amazing start for newcomers, but delve deeper into the HTML and CSS of things.

* [SkeletonCSS](http://getskeleton.com/)
A personal favorite, lightweight, simple and only includes the essential grid.

* [CSS3 +Â Animations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHFOoBjPGOcWL1PnY0H1w5N_)
It took a while to learn this. It's tricky. But you'll get it down in about a week or two.

###Preprocessors ( About a week to a month. )
This is one of my favorite parts of web development. Sass. Oh. My. God. Preprocessors are a way to write better, slimmer and easier-to-read CSS. You can even go so far as to write no brackets or semicolons. It's amazing for quick prototyping, and it'll be hard to go back once you start practicing. All of my projects are written with Sass. It's ridiculous how 10 lines in Sass can equal to 30 normal CSS.

**Sass**

* [Sass website](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Sass tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2CB1F80266E986EA)

**Jade**

Jade is an amazing template engine that replaces common HTML, and goes along nicely when mixing it with frameworks like Express, Rails, Angular, etc. Not necessary, but nice to have.
* [Jade website](http://jade-lang.com/)

Yes, I know it's a lot, but bear with me, by the time you get this down, you're on to the amazing world of JS.

###Javascript and maybe jQuery ( A few months, get comfortable with JS )
This is where things get interesting. Javascript and jQuery. Because from here you can choose a JS framework or pick a backend (more into that later).
Many people fight over wether jQuery is actual programming or not. I think it is. So there's that. First, of course, to use a library we must learn the language. So:

* [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript)
This should be enough knowledge to advance into the jQuery department. What I did here was use some vanilla JS to make some websites interactive. I made 2 websites before jQuery.

* [jQuery](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery)
Although people argue jQuery is going downhill, it's just losing its popularity, but it's still an amazing tool to have under your belt to create things. Everything I do is a mix of jQuery and CoffeeScript now.

Keep in mind these guides are the basics, I went on my own from there creating imaginary projects and some client work as well. That made me better in the JS world.

###Web-Driven JavaScript ( Another few months. )

So how is JS and jQuery used in the real world and in the web? Take a look:

* [Awesome jQuery in the real world](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IyCbhul-PdeiDqmh4ooJzk)

* [More awesome real world jQuery](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABdI2V8I_SWo22tFpgh2s6_)

###Task Runners and Package Managers ( A few weeks to really get the hang of it. )

**Gulp**
 is an amazing task runner that makes things super simple. What can it do? Compile your Sass, CoffeeScript, LiveReloads, compress images, files, handle errors. You never really know you need it until you try it. It speeds development time by seconds that turn into minutes that turn into hours that turn into days, you get the idea.

*  [Gulp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHE2RsdyUNpbiVn-cfuV7Fos)

**Bower**
 is my favorite package manager. It does everything you need and more, with a simple command ```bower install skeleton``` You get the whole package installed and it's ready to use.
There is no real Bower tutorial, because it's really that dead simple to use.

* [Bower.io](http://bower.io/)

Please keep in mind that these are not all the task runners or package managers in the world. These are just the ones that I liked and clicked with me to help me learn and speed up my development process. There are other options out there, but these are my personal favorite.

###A JavaScript Framework ( Many months / The rest of your life. )

Alright, here we are. The best part of front-end web development. Why? Because we get to build real webapps now! Aren't you excited!? (You can take a breather). So, here's how it works:
A JS framework lets you have the full functionality of an app but only running on the client side, while hooking up a BaaS ( Backend as a service ) like * [Parse](https://www.parse.com/) or * [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to manage all your data for you. But there's so many!? Look here:

1. You select a JS framework. ( How? The one that has the prettiest name, has the best landing, etc.)
2. You make a simple app to test out the framework. Maybe a todo, just check things out.
3. Practice.
4. Get good.

That's it! I personally love Angular, it's flexible, and nobody tells me how to do things. At first it took some time for things to flow. Why would I even want this? I can do that in plain HMTL and CSS. But then it clicked. It all comes down to the data. When you need dynamic info to move around your app, you'll need a framework. And that's where Angular kicked me in the face and I understood it once and for all.

**You like web development but you want to make mobile apps and you know Angular?**

* [Here's the Ionic framework for you](http://ionicframework.com/)

I used Ionic in a hackathon to build a Recipe building application that interacted with the Yummmly API. It was cool and the development environment was comfortable and appropiate for a web developer.

###Backend( The rest of your life. )

This is where things start to get fuzzy. This is where all the rainbow-colored things die. I'm kidding. But this is where I had the most trouble thriving. The backend. The problem with this is having to choose (yet another) language for the server-side. There are two problems here: 1. Choosing stuff. (why are there so many options omg.) and 2. Having to learn another language. This is hard, you know HTML, CSS, JS. PLUS Sass, CoffeeScript, Jade and jQuery. Isn't that like, a lot? It is and if you're reading this, you're awesome.

**Languages**

These are the languages that I learned to become a backend developer.

1. JavaScript (duh) I knew all the front-end part, why'd I choose a different language for the backend?

It sucked. I tried [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/), I tried the [MEAN](http://meanjs.org/) Stack. And it didn't work. It didn't feel good. Express was weird, MongoDB was weird, Node itself was pretty weird, I didn't get the hang of things and things didn't move for a few months.

Keep in mind that these frameworks are AWESOME and everybody should try them at least once if they don't love it at first sight.

I tried it for a few months, mostly March through May (2015) and I didn't get anywhere. So for now, JS goes in the front-end side of things for me.

2. Ruby <3 I didn't want to do it at first 'Ew, why Ruby?', but then I took some lessons (listed here) and now I'm in love. The language itself is elegant and expressive, there are tons of ways to do tons of things, and that's where I discovered Ruby on Rails.

* [Ruby course](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby)
* [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
* [Ruby references](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby)
* [Awesome Ruby](https://github.com/markets/awesome-ruby)

I did all that and read a few books (in the book section) and I was ready to take on rails.

**Rails**

Rails is cool, it helps you out a lot, and makes you development go fast, you don't have to worry about the annoying stuff, only the amazing, coding part and cool-as-beans building webapps part.

* [Because I know it's a pain](http://installrails.com/)

Now, this is what I did to learn Rails in a week. Yes, after a week ( 7 days, 12 hours straight ):

* [Michael Hartl's RoR Turorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/)

I have the physical copy of this, so if you see me walking around just ask.

That's it, after the book I went straight into app building. I did everything: todos, blogs, reddit clones, everything that came into my mind, I built. Why? Because it's easy to learn, that's the way to learn, practice.

* [12 in 12 challenge](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23ZvcdS3XPLNdRYB_QyomQsShx59tpc-)

Also, dig into Rails gems, many times I found myself trying to implement a functionality that someone else had already built and made into a gem so other people could use it. (Devise, Cancan, CarrierWave).

Rails resources I use almost daily:

* [Rails Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails)
* [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/)
* [Mackenzie Child](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23ZvcdS3XPKHTQBkvfxSeyeaO2EwnxlM)

I've been doing Rails since May. So that'd be about 4 Months. I have done many apps, learned many things, and I still learn new things everyday. To everybody that asks me, "How can I become a developer ASAP?". Please consider re-reading this guide, it really has all the steps to even get a good-paying job. To be a developer is not only a discipline, but a passion that takes dedication and sacrifice. Many times have I said no to a party (or something of the sort) to stay at home with some friends to keep learning. I encourage you to never stop hacking and make amazing stuff not only at hackathons or at school, but also at home, with your friend or even a startup.
