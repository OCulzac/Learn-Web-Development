#Learn the Web

**Awesome resources to become a web developer**

##Foreword
Many People have asked me the route to learn web development quickly or as fast as possible. My answer to them is: there's isn't one. Web development is such a big concept that it'd be impossible to learn in just a few months. This guide I wrote is the path I took to learn what I know about web development in a year. Naturally, this guide doesn't include all the mistakes I made and all the time I lost trying to teach myself a technology that didn't click with me. I listed all that I learned but you won't have to waste time. I will exclude things like text editors and version control because those are personal preferences. Enjoy:

## Learning Hubs
These are links to places I go to when I have a question.
* Github
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn)
* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
* [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/)
* [Webdev Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/)
* [JavaScript Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript)
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

##Guides
These links are the steps I took to learn web development, in order, and the time it takes to master it, with practice included:

###HTML and CSS( 1 to 2 months to dominate )
It is worth noting that since thisi is the base of all your development education, you shouldn't move on to the next topic before mastering html and css.
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
The HTML&CSS course, I didn't finish it, because I started practicing right off the bat. I made about 3 wesbites before moving on to the next topic. So when I came back to this course I had already learned all of it and more.

###Responsiveness, frameworks, and advanced topics ( 2 weeks to a month. )
Alright, so you think you know html and css. But what do you know about responsivness? Or frameworks like Bootstrap or Skeleton? What about animations? Not to worry I'll link them to you, no wasting time and searching on the web.

* [How to Bootstrap](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IPwMW-sSXn1Q_pVu5tUMCw)
Bootstrap is the biggest guy on the block, it has many awesome features like a grid, boxes, tables, modals, and javascript functionality. My personal problem with this, and any other frameworks is that developers never get into the responsivness of things, they don't know what's happening don't explore the possibilities and what's our there waiting for them. It's an amazing start for newcomers, but delve deeper into the HTML and CSS of things.

* [SkeletonCSS](http://getskeleton.com/)
A personal favorite, lightweight, simple and only includes the essential grid.

* [CSS3 +Â Animations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHFOoBjPGOcWL1PnY0H1w5N_)
It took a while to learn this. It's tricky. But you'll get it down in about a week or two.

###Preprocessors ( About a week to a month. )
This is one of my favorite parts of web development. Sass. Oh. My. God. Preprocessors are a way to write better, slimmer and easier-to-read CSS. You can even go so far as to write no brackets or semicolons. It's amazing for quick prototyping, and it'll be hard to go back once you start practicing. All of my projects are written with Sass. It's ridiculous how 10 lines in Sass can equal to 30 normal CSS.

Jade!
Jade is an amazing template engine that replaces common HTML, and goes along nicely when mixing it with frameworks like Express, Rails, Anuglar, etc. Not necessary, but nice to have.
*[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)

Yes, I know it's a lot, but bear with me, by the time you get to the 5th video you'll know almost everything there is to know about preprocessors.

###Javascript and maybe jQuery ( A few months, get comfortable with JS )
This is where things get interesting. Javascript and jQuery. Because from here you can choose a JS framework or pick a backend (more into that later).
Many people fight over wether jQuery is actual programming or not. I think it is. So there's that. First, of course, to use a library we must learn the language. So:

* [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript)
This should be enough knowledge to advance into the jQuery department. What I did here was use some vanilla JS to make some websites interactive. I made 2 websites before jQuery.

* [jQuery](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery)
Although people argue jQuery is going downhill, it's just losing its popularity, but it's still an amazing tool to have under your belt to create things. Everything I do is a mix of jQuery and CoffeeScript now.

Keep in mind these guides are the basics, I went on my own from there creating imaginary projects and some client work as well. That made me better in the JS world.

###Web-Driven JavaScript( Another few months. )

So how is JS and jQuery used in the real world and in the web? Take a look:

###Task Runners and Package Managers ( A month to really get the hang of it)
